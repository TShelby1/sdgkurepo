    <p>My name is <b>Albert Lara</b> and I am originally from Palm Springs California. Some people call me <i>Albie.</i> On my personal time I like to hangout with my girlfriend, try new food places, and explore with my dog. I currently work as  a System Admin for Infinity laboratories. The company is a biotech company, and offers a numerous amount of services to pharmeceutical and medical companies. We also sterilize items that are intended to be in use during surgery. <mark>Although it is a medical company, I provide the IT expertise</mark> </p>

    <p>I like where I work now but, <sub>personally</sub> I would prefer to be in a role where I know what is expected from me in that day.<del> I DO NOT</del> want to be in a role where there is no room for advancement. I consider myself a lifetime learner, so, I feel like this is a good field for me, with ever evolving technologies and practices.<sup>I hope</sup> I learn as much as I can from this course, and im excited to be here!!</p>
