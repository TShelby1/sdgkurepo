       <h1>About</h1>
       <p>My name is Albert Lara and Im from Palm Springs California originally. I joined the Army in 2015 as a Combat Engineer. I was a Team Leader during my time being a combat engineer. I got out at the end of 2018 and started my work journey doing IT. I didnt like the job so I decided to make a career change to a personal trainer while I pursued school. The pandemic happened, and I could no longer train.</p>
       <p>I'm currently working as a System Admin for a biotech company. I handle all systems and help desk support. I also lead the IT department through site aquisitions by getting ISP contracts, server and netoworking equipment, active directory, data migration, O365, and phone systems.
